# IrataJaguar
The source code for IrataJaguar (CRACKED, No Google Verification)

Since the developer is witholding the code for the ONLY working Atari Jaguar emulator, we provide it free of charge.

Here it is.

Taken using decompiler.

This is only the source for the GUI, as the emulator itself seems to be wrapped up in core .SO files (but seperately
compiled for each platform). It will take more work to decompile those.
